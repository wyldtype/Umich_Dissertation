\contentsline {table}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces An example table with things in it. See \href {https://www.latex-tables.com/}{\nolinkurl {https://www.latex-tables.com/}} for a relatively-easy latex table generator. Other options include \href {https://truben.no/table/old/}{\nolinkurl {https://truben.no/table/old/}} and \href {https://www.tablesgenerator.com/}{\nolinkurl {https://www.tablesgenerator.com/}}, but you'll find others online, too! Here, we're also showing that you can create URLs that link to external websites while still being underlined. You can use ``\textbackslash url\{\}'' for shorter URLs, but they will roll over the end of the line if they're too long. In that case, it's more accessible if you use ``\textbackslash href\{\textless url\textgreater \}\{\textless text\textgreater \}'' instead because it breaks at spaces in the text.}}{2}{table.caption.15}%
